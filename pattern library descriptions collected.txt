Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using colour to add meaning to a button only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the colour is either obvious from the content itself (the visible text of the button), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the .sr-only class.

Examples of standard form controls supported in an example form layout.

Checkboxes and radios
Checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list, while radios are for selecting one option from many.

Disabled checkboxes and radios are supported, but to provide a "not-allowed" cursor on hover of the parent <label>, you'll need to add the .disabled class to the parent .radio, .radio-inline, .checkbox, or .checkbox-inline.

navigation-03-breadcrumb.txt

Breadcrumbs
A breadcrumb trail consists of a list of links to the parent pages of the current page in hierarchical order. It helps users find their place within a website or web application. Breadcrumbs are often placed horizontally before a page's main content.

Accessibility Features
- The set of links is structured using an ordered list .
- A nav element labeled Breadcrumb identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate.
- To prevent screen reader announcement of the visual separators between links, they are added via CSS:
	- The separators are part of the visual presentation that signifies the breadcrumb trail, which is already semantically represented by the nav element with its label of Breadcrumb. So, using a display technique that is not represented in the accessibility tree used by screen readers prevents redundant and potentially distracting verbosity.
	- Each link has a border on one side that is skewed with the CSS’ transform property so it resembles a slash.

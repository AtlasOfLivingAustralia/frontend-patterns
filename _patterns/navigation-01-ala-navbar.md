#####ALA navbar
The navbar labels are designed to let the user know how to use the ALA website. New users will be directed to the `“start exploring”` dropdown menu which contains the core areas of the site for new users.

The `“search & analyse”` dropdown menu groups together relevant functions for finding, downloading and analysing data sets.

`"Participate"` focuses on ways the user can participate or contribute to the ALA, including citizen science, recording sightings and submitting datasets.

`”Learn about the ALA"` has specific information on who we are, how to use our site effectively, provides insight into what we are about and what we are doing as an organisation and provides ways to contact us and provide feedback.

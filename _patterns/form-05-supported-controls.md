Examples of standard form controls supported in an example form layout.

Checkboxes and radios:
Checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list, while radios are for selecting one option from many.

Disabled checkboxes and radios are supported, but to provide a "not-allowed" cursor on hover of the parent <label>, you'll need to add the .disabled class to the parent .radio, .radio-inline, .checkbox, or .checkbox-inline.

Selects:
Note that many native select menus—namely in Safari and Chrome—have rounded corners that cannot be modified via border-radius properties.

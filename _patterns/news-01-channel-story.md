**News channel story:**
Channel stories panels are presented on the News landing page, `https://www.ala.org.au/category/blogs-news/` and have a title category, a news article heading, a date that the article was published and any relevant tags to provide additional context. The channel story is a link that takes the user to the full news article.

The image to the right of the channel story panel is pulled from the main news article. If no images are used in the news article, then no image will appear in the channel story panel. Default ALA article image options are also available.

The Sidebar Table of Contents (TOC) is designed to give article pages a mini-information architecture. This allows the user to jump to the relevant section and move throughout the page as required.

In WordPress, the following page templates have the TOC added automatically: `Knowledge base` and `Article`.

Note that the TOC automatically picks up on h4 titles to generate the Page Contents TOC.

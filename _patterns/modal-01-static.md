Modals are streamlined, but flexible, dialog prompts with the minimum required functionality and smart defaults.

#####Static example
A rendered modal with header, body, and set of actions in the footer.

#####Modal markup placement
Always try to place a modal's HTML code in a top-level position in your document to avoid other components affecting the modal's appearance and/or functionality.

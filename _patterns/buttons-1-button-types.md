#####Button tags
Use the button classes on an `<a>`, `<button>`, or `<input>` element.

#####Links acting as buttons
If the `<a>` elements are used to act as buttons – triggering in-page functionality, rather than navigating to another document or section within the current page – they should also be given an appropriate `role="button"`.

Focus state:
The default outline styles are removed on some form controls and a box-shadow is applied in its place for :focus.

Disabled state:
Add the disabled boolean attribute on an input to prevent user interactions. Disabled inputs appear lighter and add a not-allowed cursor.

Disabled fieldsets:
Add the disabled attribute to a <fieldset> to disable all the controls within the <fieldset> at once.

Readonly state:
Add the readonly boolean attribute on an input to prevent modification of the input's value. Read-only inputs appear lighter (just like disabled inputs), but retain the standard cursor.

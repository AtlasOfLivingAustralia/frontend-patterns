Most common form control, text-based input fields. Includes support for all HTML5 types: `text`, `password`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `date`, `month`, `time`, `week`, `number`, `email`, `url`, `search`, `tel`, and `color`.

Extend form controls by adding text or buttons before, after, or on both sides of any text-based `<input>`. Use `.input-group` with an `.input-group-addon` or `.input-group-btn` to prepend or append elements to a single `.form-control`.

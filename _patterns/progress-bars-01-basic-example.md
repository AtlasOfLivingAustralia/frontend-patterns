**Progress bars:**
Provide up-to-date feedback on the progress of a workflow or action with simple yet flexible progress bars.

**Basic example: Default progress bar**
With label: Remove the `<span>` with `.sr-only` class from within the progress bar to show a visible percentage.

To ensure that the label text remains legible even for low percentages, consider adding a min-width to the progress bar.

**Contextual alternatives:**
Progress bars use some of the same button and alert classes for consistent styles.

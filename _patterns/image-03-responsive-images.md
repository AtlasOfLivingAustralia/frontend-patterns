Responsive images:
Images in Bootstrap 3 can be made responsive-friendly via the addition of the .img-responsive class. This applies max-width: 100%;, height: auto; and display: block; to the image so that it scales nicely to the parent element.

To center images which use the .img-responsive class, use .center-block instead of .text-center. See the helper classes section for more details about .center-block usage.
